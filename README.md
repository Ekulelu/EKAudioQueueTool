# EKAudioQueueTool

### Welcome to EKAudioQueueTool.
This small framework is based on AudioQueue and a great framework AudioStreamer. 

This framework can play local and online stream audio, can seek time, and cache the download audio files.   
When cache the audio file, the framework create a dat file to mark the audio file for distinguishing the 
part downloaded and not download. And at most time, will only download the not-download part.
